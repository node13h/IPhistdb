Future plans:

* IPv6 support


I think IPhistdb* repos should be joined into similar tree:

IPstory
  ipstorydb
    aggdb.py
    ischistdb.py
  importers
    dhcpd.py (maintenance as cli argument)
    cnr.py (maintenance as cli argument)
  routines
    aggregate.py
  api
    django app here
  doc
  sql
  examples
