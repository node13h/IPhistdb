IP history for ISC dhcpd 

Check INSTALL for installation instructions

This set of scripts parses dhcpd log files and imports history records 
into MySQL database.

Later lease history can be searched by using search.py script.

Multiple failover servers are supported as long as every server processes log 
files to the same database.

Example:

./search.py 192.168.0.1
